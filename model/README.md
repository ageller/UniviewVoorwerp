A brief walk-through:

* Created polygons for the shapes
* Gave each it's own unique material name (replaced the lambert default with another lambert so that I could rename it).
* In the v2 files, I deform the elements with various textures (following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq9VYGpnkh4) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4f6djBtnA0) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdvHYnt10zI) and [this](https://vimeo.com/164069049)).

The 3D model files are stored on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19WwCiRrXVPFt6H-v-VfyNj2XC25TW3PM?usp=sharing).  There are various versions, but the current one is:

* BlazarSolidModel_v2.2.obj
* BlazarSolidModel_v2.2.mtl

You will need to download both of these files and place them in the data directory to run this module.
